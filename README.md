# Image-captioning
Image captioning generates descriptions for images, aiding in applications like analyzing unlabeled images, guiding self-driving cars, and assisting blind people. Using deep learning models, specifically a CNN (DenseNet) as the encoder and a RNN (LSTM) as the decoder, captions are generated by combining image features and vocabulary.
